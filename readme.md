⚠ DISCLAIMER: Don't bring this into production. ⚠

This repository is public for educational purposes, and to allow auditing and improvement of the code. The vision is for this backend to be decentralized. That means to work peer-to-peer and without servers. To achieve this we are [researching](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development) technologies such as Ethereum and IPFS. These technologies are still young and in our eyes not ready to be taken into production. 

We built this implementation of the platform to be able to provide value to and get feedback from end users. While we think decentralisation is important, building something useful is even more important for us. This implementation facilitates us in doing that. If you want to contribute you are most welcome, but we would also encourage you to invest your energies in the decentralized (and unlicenced) version of the platform: [https://github.com/teamforus/rd-ethereum-platform](https://github.com/teamforus/rd-ethereum-platform)

This limitation will be in place until user data is securely stored on the device (smartphone) of the end user or encrypted on a decentralized file storage system (e.g. IPFS) with the encryption key in control of the user (e.g. on device or at a storage service of their choice).
